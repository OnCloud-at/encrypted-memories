# Smart Search

Smart Search builds an encrypted, on-device index for private discovery across the photo library.

## Turn on Smart Search

In Settings, turn on **Smart Search**. It starts at once with the search model that suits your device language: **Fast and efficient** for English, **Accurate and multilingual** for other languages. The app downloads the model and indexes your library on this device. Text search already works while the model downloads.

You can choose the other model at any time. While the first model still downloads, the choice stops that download and takes the other model without asking. Later, a switch asks first, because the library is then indexed again.

When the device has too little free space for the model, Smart Search shows how much space it needs. Free up space and select **Retry**.

Turning Smart Search off deletes the model and the search index from this device.

## Current search scopes

- **All:** Combines available search sources.
- **Text:** Searches recognized text from images and documents.

The app shows **Text** only when its local Apple Vision index is available. Initial indexing can take time and can pause when foreground library work has priority.

Descriptive searches, for example beaches or dogs, use the chosen search model. The models come from a signed model catalog. Document, barcode, and similar-image pipelines are not separate user-selectable scopes in the current app.

## Search suggestions

When the search field is empty, Search suggests entries from your own library:

- Places and places in a season, for example a city in summer.
- Trips, seasons, and photos from this day in earlier years.
- Favorites from a year.
- Media types, for example Videos or Live Photos.
- Photo content, for example beaches or dogs. This needs the search model and a finished index.

Select a suggestion to show exactly the photos that belong to it. The app builds suggestions on the device while it is idle. It pauses this work during an active search, video playback, exports that you start, Low Power Mode, and high device temperature. The first build can take several minutes for a large library. After a restart, the app shows the saved suggestions at once if the library did not change.

Suggestion previews never show photos that the sensitive-content check did not confirm.

- **iPhone and iPad:** The Search tab shows **For You** rows with previews and your **Recent** searches.
- **Mac:** Suggestions appear in the menu of the search field.

## Privacy

- Photos and search queries are not sent to a separate search service.
- Place suggestions get their names from Apple MapKit. For this, the app sends only the rounded center of a group of photos, precise to about 1 km. See [[Settings, Cache, and Privacy|Settings-Cache-and-Privacy]].
- Model artifacts and encrypted indexes remain on the device.
- Signing out removes account-scoped local search data.

## Hardware

Smart Search does not require a Neural Engine. Apple Vision exposes supported compute devices for each request, and Core ML can use CPU, GPU, or Neural Engine. A specific scope can be unavailable when its Apple Vision request is unsupported even though the rest of the app remains available.

## Platform presentation

- **iPhone and iPad:** Use the native **Search** tab and choose an available scope below the query field.
- **Mac:** Use the search controls in the library and configure indexing in the Smart Search Settings tab.
