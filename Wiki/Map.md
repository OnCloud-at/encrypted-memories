# Map

The Map groups library items by their encrypted location metadata.

## What you see

- Individual photos at close zoom levels.
- Adaptive clusters when many photos share an area.
- A cluster series that opens the matching media in timeline order.
- Place names when the platform can resolve them.

Only media with usable location information appears. An empty Map does not mean the library is empty.

## Platform presentation

- **iPhone and iPad:** Open the **Map** tab and tap a marker or cluster.
- **Mac:** Select **Map** in the sidebar. The map stays beside the native sidebar and opens media in the shared viewer.

The local location index is account-scoped and encrypted at rest. Apple MapKit provides the native map surface and the place names. To resolve a place name, the app sends the location coordinates to Apple.

After you opened the Map once on a device, the app loads the map area it opens at while the app starts, so the Map appears without a grey background. Like opening the Map, this requests the map tiles of that area from Apple. Signing out resets it.
